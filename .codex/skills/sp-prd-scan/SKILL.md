## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



# `/sp.prd-scan` Reconstruction Scan

## Workflow Contract Summary

This summary is routing metadata only. The full workflow contract is the frontmatter plus the sections below.

- Use `sp-prd-scan` for read-only reconstruction investigation.
- Primary truth source: current repository reality plus the `project-cognition query` bundle and compatibility/export evidence when explicitly needed.
- Primary terminal state: completed scan package under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/`.
- Stable freshness state: `.specify/prd/status.json`.
- Default handoff: `/sp-prd-build`.

<!-- SEMANTIC_WORK_CONTRACT_BEGIN -->
## Semantic Work Contract

[AGENT] Treat every project-cognition-backed request as natural-language intake first, regardless of whether the eventual work looks like planning, research, debugging, implementation, review, or map maintenance.

- **Single unified entrypoint**: the agent is the semantic mediator between the user's words and the project's stored vocabulary. Do not choose debug, implement, plan, or research from the user's raw words. First normalize the request into project terms, surfaces, constraints, exclusions, and evidence needs.
- **WorkContract v1**: before route or write-scope decisions, carry a contract with `raw_request`, `normalized_goal`, `semantic_intake`, `selected_concept_ids`, `rejected_concept_ids`, `evidence_plan`, `permission_decision`, and `learning_contract`.
- **Facet coverage**: keep `semantic_intake` decisions explicit about covered facets, missing facets, match sources, and rejected false friends; do not collapse the candidate universe into one top-similarity route.
- **Runtime path**: use compass-first navigation for ordinary generated workflows. Run or emulate `project-cognition compass --intent <intent> --query "$ARGUMENTS" --format json` as the default brownfield intake, then use semantic-intake escalation when the compass packet is draft-like, localized, symptom-first, mixed-language, missing coverage, or needs explicit concept decisions. When that escalation is available, run or emulate `project-cognition semantic-intake --input <work-contract-input.json> --format json`; if the command is unavailable, manually produce the same fields from the alias catalog and existing compass/query guidance.
- **Semantic-intake evidence boundary**: `semantic-intake` can rank candidates, explain match basis, reject false friends, suggest `minimal_live_reads`, and name missing facets. It is not proof that a bug exists, a design is correct, a fix is safe, or a release is ready.
- **v1.1 audit artifact**: when semantic-intake escalation influences routing, capture a replayable WorkContract artifact with the semantic-intake input/output snapshot, selected/rejected basis, permission upgrade/downgrade reason, action log, and route corrections. If available, run or emulate `project-cognition semantic-audit --input <semantic-audit-input.json> --format json` to build that record. The audit artifact records why the route was chosen; it does not authorize source changes, does not read live source, does not raise permission above P2, and does not replace workflow verification.
- **Audit fallback**: if semantic-audit is unavailable, manually produce the same semantic_audit_input fields from the WorkContract, semantic-intake input/output, route decision, permission decision, action log, and route corrections. Do not block on installing a newer runtime solely for semantic-audit; continue only under the lower available permission and prove any later claims with live evidence.
- **v1.2 evidence-guided inspection**: when semantic-audit returns inspection_plan, treat it as the only P2 live-read plan. inspection_plan maps each missing facet or evidence need to a bounded target. Execute targeted_read only for listed target_path or target_id; do not broaden reads from raw user wording. Capture live_evidence_capture before raising permission. Use rerank_after_inspect before any root-cause, fixed, complete, or release-safe claim. Apply stale_index_downgrade when runtime is unavailable, stale, missing owners, or contradicted by live evidence.
- **v1.2.1 captured evidence gate**: workflow-captured live_evidence_capture may feed rerank_assessment, but live evidence can create a permission_promotion_candidate only. candidate_only is not granted permission, not authorization to edit, and not a final claim. route_contradicted downgrades permission, blocks targeted_inspect/change/final claims, and requires rerunning semantic-intake or choosing another route.
- **v1.2.2 owner confidence**: owner_bundle_confidence summarizes indexed owner roles for selected candidates; it is confidence, not live proof. owner_miss_expansion max_radius is 1. If no bounded target_id exists, stop and request map update or user clarification; do not broaden reads.
- **v1.2.3 live source boundary**: route vocabulary evidence is not live source evidence. A live_evidence_capture item may support rerank_assessment only when `source_kind` is `source`, `read_path` names the bounded source read from inspection_plan or selected owner hints, and `supports_candidate` or `contradicts_candidate` is explicit. Otherwise permission_promotion_candidate stays blocked by live_source_evidence_required and bounded_source_evidence_required.
- **v1.3 verification owner discovery**: verification_owner_discovery identifies indexed or missing verification owners and targeted_test candidates. It does not grant P3/P4, does not mark work fixed, and keeps promotion_blocked true until workflow authorization and verification results exist.
- **v1.3.1 verification result ingestion**: verification_results may be recorded after the workflow runs targeted verification. A result satisfies claim_readiness only when every selected candidate has an indexed verification owner, status is passed, and verification_path matches an indexed verification owner for the selected candidate. Without workflow_authorization, claim_status is claim_candidate, claim_ready remains false, and workflow_authorization is still required.
- **v1.3.2 workflow authorization baseline**: workflow_authorization is the explicit bridge from runtime evidence to workflow-owned claims. The v1.3.2 baseline allowed only `root_cause_claim` after bounded source evidence, matching passed verification for every selected candidate, `status: authorized`, `authorized_claims` containing `root_cause_claim`, and a non-empty `authorization_ref`.
- **v1.3.3 claim-specific final claims**: current generated workflows may mark `fixed_claim`, `completed_claim`, or `release_safe` claim_ready only when every selected candidate has claim-specific passed verification, top-level workflow_authorization has `status: authorized`, `authorized_claims` contains that claim, and workflow_authorization contains a matching `claim_authorizations[]` entry with `status: authorized`, a non-empty `authorization_ref`, and `verification_evidence_refs` covering the matched verification results. Empty verification `claim_type` is legacy-compatible only for `root_cause_claim`. Claim readiness still does not grant P3/P4 permission, unblock source edits, or prove release safety beyond the named claim.
- **v1.3.18 verification outcome policy**: failed verification results block final claims until superseded by a newer matching passed rerun and surface `verification_result_failed`; blocked verification results block final claims until recovery or rerun produces a newer matching passed result and surface `verification_result_blocked`; skipped or otherwise inconclusive verification results block final claims and surface `verification_result_inconclusive`. A newer passed rerun may recover claim candidacy only when it matches the same indexed verification owner path and selected candidate. These blockers explain verification state; they do not prove root cause, authorize source edits, or grant P3/P4 permission.
- **v1.3.19 active claim authorization policy**: workflow_authorization.active_claim_type records the single active final claim when a workflow authorizes more than one claim type. Multiple authorized claims require explicit active_claim_type; otherwise claim readiness stays blocked with `active_claim_type_required`. If active_claim_type is not listed in authorized_claims, claim readiness stays blocked with `active_claim_not_authorized`. Single-claim authorization remains backward-compatible and still does not infer claims from workflow names.
- **v1.3.4 audit state persistence**: persist semantic-audit-input.json and semantic-audit-output.json next to the active workflow state. Use `semantic_audit_input_path` and `semantic_audit_output_path` to record the exact files, with `<WORKFLOW_STATE_DIR>/semantic-audit-input.json` and `<WORKFLOW_STATE_DIR>/semantic-audit-output.json` as the default when a workflow-state directory exists. On resume, re-read `semantic_audit_state`, both persisted audit files, `claim_authorization_refs`, and `claim_verification_refs` before recomputing claim_readiness or making final claims. If any referenced file is missing, stale, or inconsistent with the current route decision, set `semantic_audit_resume_status` to `missing|stale|needs-rerun` and rerun or rebuild the audit instead of trusting chat memory.
- **v1.3.5 resume validation**: before trusting persisted claim_readiness on resume, compare selected_candidate_ids, active_claim_type, claim_authorization_refs, and claim_verification_refs from workflow state against the persisted semantic-audit-output.json. Record the comparison in `semantic_audit_resume_validation` and `semantic_audit_route_fingerprint`. If selected candidates, active claim type, authorization refs, verification refs, or route decision fingerprint differ, set `semantic_audit_resume_status: needs-rerun` and rebuild semantic-audit-input.json before any final claim.
- **v1.3.6 generated resume smoke**: generated workflows must perform a prompt-level generated resume smoke before trusting persisted semantic-audit state. Verify that semantic-audit-input.json and semantic-audit-output.json exist. Compare selected_candidate_ids, active_claim_type, and semantic_audit_route_fingerprint against workflow state plus `semantic-audit-input.json.semantic_audit_input.route_decision`; compare claim_authorization_refs and claim_verification_refs against `semantic-audit-output.json.workflow_authorization and semantic-audit-output.json.claim_readiness`. Record `semantic_audit_generated_resume_smoke` and `semantic_audit_stale_reasons`. Stale-state detection remains prompt-only in v1.3.6. Fingerprint mismatches are route-changed. Use the semantic audit resume examples at `.specify/templates/examples/semantic-audit-resume/scenarios.md` when available. If any smoke check fails, set `semantic_audit_resume_status: needs-rerun`, keep claim_ready false, and rebuild semantic-audit-input.json before any final claim.
- **v1.3.9 optional runtime validator**: when available, generated workflows may run `project-cognition semantic-audit-resume --input <resume-validation.json> --format json` as an optional runtime validator for the same resume smoke. The input should contain extracted workflow state plus concrete paths to persisted semantic-audit-input.json and semantic-audit-output.json; do not require the runtime to parse workflow-state.md. Prompt fallback remains valid when the command is unavailable, blocked, or unnecessary. The validator is a comparison helper only and does not authorize source edits, final claims, or P3/P4 permission. Its output records `validator: semantic-audit-resume`, `can_reuse_persisted_claim_readiness`, `grants_permission: false`, and `boundary: comparison_only_no_source_edit_or_claim_authorization`.
- **v1.3.10 downstream validator examples**: generated projects include concrete runtime-adoption fixtures under `.specify/templates/examples/semantic-audit-resume/`. Use `resume-validation.json` as the fresh example and `resume-validation-route-changed.json` as the stale route example; both reference sibling `semantic-audit-input.json` and `semantic-audit-output.json`. These examples demonstrate the optional validator input shape and expected output without making the validator mandatory.
- **v1.3.11 resume validator workflow preference**: on resume, prefer the optional runtime validator when a compatible `project-cognition semantic-audit-resume` command is available. Build an ephemeral resume-validation.json from the current workflow state's semantic_audit_state plus concrete `semantic_audit_input_path` and `semantic_audit_output_path`, run the validator, and copy its smoke status, validation status, stale reasons, and reuse decision back into workflow state. If the validator returns fresh and `can_reuse_persisted_claim_readiness: true`, the workflow may reuse persisted claim readiness for the same active claim; this still does not grant P3/P4 permission or source edits. If the validator is unavailable, blocked, or returns stale output, prompt fallback remains valid and any failed result keeps final claims blocked until semantic-audit-input.json is rebuilt.
- **v1.3.12 stale case matrix**: generated projects also include executable stale fixtures for `resume-validation-active-claim-changed.json`, `resume-validation-missing-file.json`, `resume-validation-claim-ref-mismatch.json`, and `resume-validation-verification-ref-mismatch.json`. Use them to understand how the optional validator reports each stale reason before trusting resumed claim readiness.
- **v1.3.13 real downstream resume smoke**: generated-project tests verify the validator with workflow-local semantic-audit-input.json and workflow-local semantic-audit-output.json under an actual downstream state directory, plus an ephemeral resume-validation.json built from that local state. Treat this as the adoption proof: examples teach the shape, while workflow-local files prove path resolution and resume behavior.
- **Workflow-written audit input**: when a workflow uses semantic-intake escalation, write or carry `semantic-audit-input.json` in workflow state before broad live reads. The object is named `"semantic_audit_input"` in notes/handoffs and has this minimum shape:

- **PermissionDecision**: carry `maximum_without_live_evidence` explicitly.
  - `P0`: no usable cognition baseline; ask for or gather minimal live evidence before route claims.
  - `P1`: route/read-only candidate selection only; no source edits.
  - `P2`: bounded live reads and artifact planning are allowed; source edits still require workflow authorization plus live evidence.
  - Higher permissions require live repository evidence, active workflow rules, and verification signals outside semantic intake.
- **Permission-gated actions**: do not use semantic intake alone to authorize source changes, destructive operations, dependency changes, broad refactors, root-cause claims, fixed claims, complete claims, or release-safe claims.
- **LearningContract**: carry the memory level separately from action permission.
  - `M0`: no durable learning; runtime unavailable, match ambiguous, or evidence missing.
  - `M1`: candidate lesson only; record in working state if useful, but do not promote as durable project truth.
  - `M2`: durable learning only after live evidence or verified artifacts prove the lesson is reusable.
- **Final claim gate**: do not claim root cause, fixed, complete, or release-safe from `semantic-intake`, alias ranking, or similarity alone. Root-cause claims require bounded live source evidence, matching passed verification for every selected candidate, and explicit workflow_authorization. Fixed, complete, and release-safe claims additionally require claim-specific passed verification and a matching claim_authorizations entry. Multiple authorized claims require explicit active_claim_type. Failed, blocked, skipped, or inconclusive verification blocks final claims until a newer matching passed rerun supersedes it. These gates do not grant source-edit permission or release approval beyond the named claim.

## Objective

[AGENT] Produce a reconstruction-grade scan package that lets `sp-prd-build` compile a PRD suite without rereading the repository.

The scan phase is a read-only reconstruction investigation. It must harvest enough grounded detail about each `capability`, `artifact`, and `boundary` to prove whether the package is reconstruction-ready or should be marked `blocked-by-gap`.
Every consequential claim must preserve `Evidence`, `Inference`, and `Unknown` labeling semantics instead of collapsing them into one unmarked narrative.

## Context

Required context inputs:

- **Project cognition gate:** query the active project's runtime before broad
  repository reads.

  Run or emulate:

  ```text
  'C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe' compass --intent research '--query=$ARGUMENTS' --format json
  ```

  After the default compass packet, run the advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` path only when `compass_state`, coverage diagnostics, localization, or live evidence requires explicit concept decisions. In that escalation, use `project-cognition lexicon --mode catalog` as the alias catalog, write agent-authored `semantic_intake` and `concept_decisions`, then run `project-cognition query --query-plan "<query_plan_json>"`; include `query_plan`, `semantic_intake`, `concept_decisions`, `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, `match_sources`, `lexicon_generation_id`, `repository_search_terms`, project-language search terms, and facet coverage; do not search only the raw user words before source search. Agent-owned semantic normalization remains mandatory: `agent_normalization` and raw lexicon ranking are bootstrap signals only; if `agent_normalization` is omitted, treat it as `required=false`; use `write_semantic_intake_from_alias_catalog` when needed. Raw lexicon ranking is only a bootstrap; CJK or mixed CJK/ASCII input still requires agent-owned normalization even when positive raw lexical matches exist. The agent still owns translation. Readiness values are `query_ready`, `review`, `needs_rebuild`, `blocked`, and `unsupported_runtime`.

  Use the returned readiness:

  - `query_ready`: read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons.
  - `review`: perform only the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing and inspect `coverage_diagnostics`.
  - `blocked`: report the blocking runtime issue and continue with live evidence only where this workflow allows degraded navigation.
- `PROJECT-HANDBOOK.md` only when compatibility/export evidence is explicitly relevant.
- `.specify/prd/status.json` as the stable PRD scan freshness record when present.
- Current repository evidence from code, docs, tests, routes, UI surfaces, service surfaces, data models, integrations, configuration, and deployment surfaces.
- Existing `workflow-state.md` under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/` when resuming an interrupted run.

## Mandatory Subagent Execution

All substantive tasks in ordinary `sp-*` workflows default to and must use subagents.

The leader orchestrates: route, split tasks, prepare task contracts, dispatch subagents, wait for structured handoffs, integrate results, verify, and update state.

Before dispatch, every subagent lane needs a task contract with objective, authoritative inputs, allowed read scope, forbidden actions, acceptance checks, verification evidence, and structured handoff format.

Use `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`.
Use `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`.
Use `execution_surface: native-subagents`.
Each delegated lane produces a `PrdScanPacket`: a read-only evidence packet with enough cited detail for the build step to synthesize the final archive without rereading the repository.

## Unified Critical Item Families

1. Main Capability Chains
2. External Entrypoints and Command Surfaces
3. State Machines and Flow Control
4. Data and Persistence Contracts
5. Configuration and Behavior Switches
6. Protocol and Boundary Contracts
7. Error Semantics and Recovery Behavior
8. Verification and Regression Entrypoints

## Evidence Depth Model

- `L1 Exists`: the item is discovered and tied to at least one repository surface.
- `L2 Surface`: the user-visible, command, API, config, data, or boundary shape is captured.
- `L3 Behavioral`: normal behavior, edge behavior, state changes, and failure behavior are grounded in evidence.
- `L4 Reconstruction-Ready`: enough structure, contracts, and verification evidence exist to recreate the behavior without critical unknowns.

## Hard Boundary

- `sp-prd-scan` must not write `master/master-pack.md`.
- `sp-prd-scan` must not write `exports/**`.
- `sp-prd-scan` must not claim the PRD suite is complete.

## PRD Run State Protocol

- `workflow-state.md` under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/` is the resumable state surface for `sp-prd-scan` and `sp-prd-build`.
- [AGENT] Create or resume `workflow-state.md` before substantial scan work.
- If `workflow-state.md` exists with `active_command: sp-prd-scan` and a non-terminal scan state, resume from it instead of rebuilding intent from chat memory.
- Track at least:
  - `active_command: sp-prd-scan`
  - `status: scanning | synthesizing | blocked | ready-for-build`
  - `scan_status: pending | scanning | blocked | complete`
  - `build_status`
  - `freshness_mode`
  - `classification`
  - `selected_capabilities`
  - `selected_boundaries`
  - `selected_artifacts`
  - `current_packet`
  - `accepted_packet_results`
  - `rejected_packet_results`
  - `failed_readiness_checks`
  - `next_action`
  - `next_command`
  - `handoff_reason`
  - `open_gaps`

## Process

1. Route and initialize the PRD run under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/`.
2. Load brownfield context and select the smallest relevant repository surfaces.
3. Check `.specify/prd/status.json` freshness before scoping the scan.
4. Route `fresh` status to status confirmation only unless the user explicitly requests a new run.
5. Route `targeted-stale` status to a bounded scan of the changed source, test, and documentation surfaces plus any directly adjacent capability boundaries.
6. Route `full-stale` status to a full reconstruction scan across command, workflow, integration, configuration, and shared-runtime surfaces.
7. Triage `capability`, `artifact`, and `boundary` objects before broad synthesis.
8. Assign each capability a tier: `critical`, `high`, `standard`, or `auxiliary`.
9. Before broad scan fan-out begins, assess workload shape and the current agent capability snapshot, then apply the shared policy contract: `choose_subagent_dispatch(command_name="prd-scan", snapshot, workload_shape)`.
10. Persist the decision fields exactly: `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`, `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`, `execution_surface: native-subagents`.
11. Decision order is fixed:
    - One safe validated scan lane -> `one-subagent` on `native-subagents` when available.
    - Two or more safe read-only scan lanes -> `parallel-subagents` on `native-subagents` when available.
    - No safe lane, incomplete packet, or unavailable delegation -> `subagent-blocked` with a recorded reason.
12. Compile a validated `PrdScanPacket` before dispatch or `subagent-blocked` status.
13. For `one-subagent`, dispatch one read-only scan lane once a validated `PrdScanPacket` exists. If the packet is incomplete, compile the missing fields before dispatch; if dispatch is unavailable, record `subagent-blocked` with the blocker and stop for escalation or recovery before broad scan work continues.
14. If collaboration is justified, keep `prd-scan` lanes read-only and limited to reconstruction evidence gathering, tier classification, and packet drafting.
15. Required join points:
    - before freezing ledgers and machine-readable contracts
    - before declaring the package ready for `sp-prd-build`
16. The leader owns final ledger normalization, contract updates, and packet quality even when subagents help with scan work.
17. For `critical` and `high` capabilities, capture stronger reconstruction detail: structure, producers, consumers, constraints, compatibility behavior, and failure behavior.
18. Build `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/artifact-contracts.json` and `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/reconstruction-checklist.json`.
19. Generate scan packets and evidence notes that explain structure, producers, consumers, constraints, and failure behavior while preserving `Evidence`, `Inference`, and `Unknown`.
20. Refuse handoff if any `critical` capability lacks reconstruction-ready support. `high` capabilities must not be waved through with path-only evidence; keep the status explicit as `blocked-by-gap` when evidence is insufficient.

## Output Contract

The scan phase writes only the reconstruction package:

- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/workflow-state.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/prd-scan.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/coverage-ledger.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/coverage-ledger.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/capability-ledger.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/artifact-contracts.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/reconstruction-checklist.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/entrypoint-ledger.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/config-contracts.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/protocol-contracts.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/state-machines.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/error-semantics.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/verification-surfaces.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/scan-packets/<lane-id>.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/evidence/**`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/worker-results/**`
- `.specify/prd/status.json` when initializing a successful scan and the stable status file is absent

These artifacts are the authoritative scan bundle for `sp-prd-build`; they are not draft exports.

## Compile And Validate PrdScanPacket Inputs

- [AGENT] Compile a validated `PrdScanPacket` before dispatch or `subagent-blocked` status.
- A valid `PrdScanPacket` must include:
  - `lane_id`
  - `mode: read_only`
  - `scope`
  - `capability_ids`
  - `artifact_ids`
  - `boundary_ids`
  - `required_reads`
  - `excluded_paths`
  - `required_questions`
  - `expected_outputs`
  - `contract_targets`
  - `forbidden_actions`
  - `result_handoff_path`
  - `join_points`
  - `minimum_verification`
  - `blocked_conditions`
- Hard rule: do not dispatch from raw scan prose or broad chat instructions alone.

## PrdScanPacket Dispatch

- If no safe lane exists, the packet is incomplete, or delegation is unavailable, record `subagent-blocked` with the blocker and stop for escalation or recovery before broad scan work continues.
- Raw inventory notes or raw chat summaries are not sufficient subagent inputs or outputs.
- Each dispatched lane needs a validated `PrdScanPacket` and must return a structured handoff with inspected paths, key facts, confidence, blockers, and recommended contract updates.
- Idle subagent output is not an accepted scan result.
- The leader must wait for every dispatched lane and consume its structured handoff before finalizing ledgers, writing scan packets, or marking the scan complete.

## Worker Result Contract

Every scan-lane result must include:

- `lane_id`
- `reported_status: done | done_with_concerns | blocked | needs_context`
- `paths_read`
- `key_facts`
- `evidence_refs`
- `recommended_contract_updates`
- `confidence`
- `unknowns`
- `minimum_verification`
- `result_handoff_path`

Reject results that omit `paths_read`, collapse evidence into prose-only summary, hide `unknowns`, or leave contract impact undefined where one is expected.

## Quality Gates

- Stable Status Gate: `.specify/prd/status.json` must be consulted or initialized, and the run must record whether freshness is `fresh`, `targeted-stale`, or `full-stale`.
- Capability Triage Gate: each capability must be assigned `critical`, `high`, `standard`, or `auxiliary` before scan completion can be claimed.
- Critical Depth Gate: each `critical` capability must be explicitly marked `reconstruction-ready` or `blocked-by-gap`, with structure, producer-consumer, constraint, and failure coverage captured.
- High Capability Gate: each `high` capability must have more than path-only evidence and must record reconstruction-relevant structure and boundary behavior.
- Artifact Contract Gate: important structures must land in `artifact-contracts.json`.
- Checklist Gate: recreation blockers and remaining `Unknown` items must be visible in `reconstruction-checklist.json`.
- Evidence Label Gate: scan outputs must preserve `Evidence`, `Inference`, and `Unknown` labeling semantics.

## Guardrails

- Do not write final PRD exports in `sp-prd-scan`.
- Do not treat path discovery as sufficient reconstruction evidence.
- Do not let `critical` or `high` capabilities pass with shallow evidence only.
- Do not hide unknowns that block a later build step.
- When refusal is required, report the smallest safe repair instead of softening the gap into narrative prose.

## Codex Subagent Capability Discovery

- Execution model: preserve the workflow's existing `subagent-mandatory`, `subagents-first`, `adaptive`, or `subagent-assisted` policy.
- Dispatch shape: preserve the workflow's existing dispatch shape; use `subagent-blocked` only after the discovery step below fails or is unsafe.
- Execution surface: prefer `native-subagents` when the current runtime supports it; use `none` only after recording the unavailable or unsafe surface.
- Native subagent capability discovery: Before recording `subagent-blocked`, confirm the current runtime exposes `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent`; if they are not visible, use the active tool discovery mechanism for multi-agent or subagent tools first.
- Do not record `subagent-blocked` until this capability discovery step is complete and the exact unavailable or unsafe surface is recorded.
- Native subagent dispatch: Dispatch bounded subagents through `spawn_agent`.
- Join behavior: Rejoin with `wait_agent`, integrate, then `close_agent`.
- Preserve this workflow's existing packet, handoff, artifact, and result schema; this section only governs capability discovery before dispatch or blocked-state recording.

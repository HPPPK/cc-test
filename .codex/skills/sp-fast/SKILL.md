## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: The work is genuinely local and low-risk enough to stay on the fast path.
- **Primary objective**: Complete the smallest safe low-risk change directly and run the smallest meaningful verification without opening the full planning workflow.
- **Primary outputs**: A tightly scoped direct change plus a concise report of what changed, what was verified, and any remaining risk.
- **Default handoff**: Upgrade immediately to /sp-quick if scope, coupling, or uncertainty expands.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Objective

Execute a trivial, low-risk task directly in the current context without entering the full `specify -> plan -> tasks` workflow.

Use this for small fixes that are faster to execute than to plan: typo fixes, tiny config changes, missing imports, narrow doc edits, small bug fixes, and similarly bounded adjustments.

## Context

- Primary inputs: the user's request, the smallest relevant local files, passive learning files, and the project cognition safety gate.
- This path exists only for truly local work; the moment that assumption breaks, the task must leave the fast lane.
- Fast-path output is intentionally small and should not spawn planning artifacts.
- Fast-path source/runtime/template/config/test/generated-asset changes follow the shared inline closeout contract:

### Inline Project Cognition Update

Workflow-owned mutation closeout is not an external map-maintenance handoff and is not external map maintenance. It is the workflow-local form of `$sp-map-update`. If this workflow changed project-related source, runtime, templates, generated assets, config, tests, state contracts, shared surfaces, or behavior-bearing docs, closeout MUST run inline project cognition update for the workflow-owned changed paths and affected surfaces before claiming clean completion.

Use the current delta session when one exists:

```text
project-cognition delta append --session "$DELTA_SESSION_ID" --event-type workflow_closeout --changed-path "<path>" --behavior-surface "<surface>" --verification "<evidence>" --known-unknown "<unknown>" --format json
project-cognition update --delta-session "$DELTA_SESSION_ID" --reason workflow-finalize --format json
```

Include `--commit-range "<base>..<head>"` only with `--delta-session` when a safe task commit boundary exists.

When no delta session exists, write a payload file under `.specify/project-cognition/updates/` and call:

```text
project-cognition update --payload-file ".specify/project-cognition/updates/<update-id>.json" --reason workflow-finalize --format json
```

The payload must include `workflow`, `reason`, `changed_paths`, `scope_paths`, `behavior_surfaces`, `generated_surfaces`, `state_contracts`, `verification`, `known_unknowns`, `confidence_notes`, `user_decisions`, and `boundary` when those facts exist.
For compatibility with worker handoffs and delta packets, the runtime also accepts `verification_evidence` as an alias for `verification` and `generated_surface_notes` as an alias for `generated_surfaces`. Verification evidence may be an array of objects (`command`, `result`, `artifact`) or an array of command-result strings, but clean closeout still requires passing verification evidence; failed verification cannot produce a clean `ready` closeout.

Clean closeout keys on `result_state`, not `update_id`, `last_update_id`, or freshness alone:

- `ready` or `no_op`: project cognition closeout may be clean when ordinary verification also passed.
- `partial_refresh`: useful update data was written, but the final workflow state must report partial cognition closeout and the returned `minimal_live_reads`.
- `needs_rebuild`: report the exact rebuild condition and route to `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build`.
- `blocked`: report the runtime or validation blocker and the exact recovery command.
- `recorded`: legacy recorded-only output; treat it as partial or blocked, never as clean completion.

Use `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe mark-dirty --reason \"<reason>\" --format json` only when inline update cannot complete: when inline update is unavailable, cannot record useful update data, cannot identify workflow-owned scope, or cannot be trusted because verification/workflow completion is not trustworthy. Dirty only when inline update cannot complete.

sp-map-update is for manual/external maintenance and follow-up repair. `$sp-map-update` remains the external/manual workflow for user edits, interrupted workflow repair, explicit map maintenance, and follow-up repair. It is not routine cleanup for changes this workflow just made.
- Upgrade out of fast immediately when senior consequence analysis triggers for lifecycle, running-state, destructive-operation, shared-state, downstream consumer, compatibility, security, or multiple-behavior impact; record only the stand-down reason if it does not trigger.

## Senior Consequence Analysis Gate

Run this gate whenever the request, artifact set, defect, or planned change can affect lifecycle operations, running objects, concurrent work, destructive behavior, shared state, downstream consumers, compatibility, security-sensitive behavior, or multiple plausible product behaviors.

Project cognition first. Use the project cognition runtime to identify ownership, consumers, state surfaces, change-propagation facts, verification routes, conflicts, known unknowns, and coverage gaps. Senior consequence analysis second. Turn those facts into explicit product and implementation obligations instead of treating the graph as the decision-maker.

Project cognition readiness provides routing advice. If readiness is `ready`, continue with the returned task-local bundle. If readiness is `review`, inspect the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing. If readiness is `ambiguous`, ask the user to choose. If readiness is `needs_update`, use `$sp-map-update` when the workflow needs updated runtime coverage for the touched area; otherwise continue with live repository evidence and carry the stale coverage gap forward. If readiness is `needs_rebuild`, continue with live repository evidence and recommend `$sp-map-scan -> $sp-map-build` only for brownfield first/missing/unusable baseline, schema failure, schema v1 or old broad-schema rebuild-required readiness, zero active-generation `path_index` rows outside `greenfield_empty`, missing or invalid `alias_index`, `explicit_rebuild_requested`, or `baseline_identity_invalid`. If readiness is `blocked`, report the blocked state and continue with live repository evidence unless the user's actual request is to fix cognition runtime state. If `baseline_kind=greenfield_empty`, continue with workflow artifacts and live requirements; do not recommend map-scan -> map-build solely because the graph has no paths. Carry relevant project cognition facts, returned `minimal_live_reads`, inference notes, and coverage gaps into the workflow's artifacts or durable state, but back consequence claims with live code, tests, scripts, configuration, or authoritative docs. Mutation closeout is separate from entry routing: entry stale may continue, but that does not allow source/runtime mutation workflows to defer closeout. Workflow-owned mutation closeout is not an external map-maintenance handoff; after changing project-related files or behavior, the workflow must run inline project cognition update from its changed paths, affected surfaces, and verification evidence, with `project-cognition mark-dirty` only as fallback when inline update cannot complete. `sp-map-update` is for manual/external maintenance and follow-up repair; it is external map maintenance, not routine closeout for this workflow's own changes. In shared routing summaries, sp-map-update is for manual/external maintenance.

Required output when the gate triggers:

- **Affected Object Map**: name each object, record, worker, queue, artifact, command, API, file surface, user-visible state, or downstream consumer that can be affected.
- **State-Behavior Matrix**: describe behavior for each important lifecycle state, including created, queued, running, paused, failed, cancelled, completed, resumed, archived, missing, stale, or partially refreshed states when relevant.
- **Dependency Impact Table**: map direct dependencies, indirect consumers, shared state, compatibility surfaces, validation routes, and adjacent workflows that can break if semantics change.
- **Recovery And Validation Contract**: state rollback, retry, idempotency, cleanup, migration, observability, and validation evidence required before handoff or completion.
- **Coverage Gaps**: list what project cognition or live evidence cannot prove, who must resolve each gap, the latest safe resolve phase, the stop-and-reopen condition, and the routing decision: current workflow may continue with an assumption, must ask the user, must route to clarification or deep research, or must request map maintenance.
- **Consequence Obligations**: assign stable `CA-###` IDs to every obligation that must survive downstream handoff, task generation, worker packets, verification, or debug closeout. Each `CA-###` must include claim, affected objects, owner workflow, latest resolve phase, status, and stop-and-reopen condition.

Stand down only for docs-only wording changes, trivial isolated fixes, or local refactors that cannot affect lifecycle operations, running state, destructive operations, shared state, downstream consumers, compatibility, security, or multiple behavior choices. Record the no-trigger reason or stand-down reason in the workflow's durable artifact or closeout before skipping the required outputs.

If the gate triggers and the current workflow cannot preserve the required outputs, stop and route to the workflow that can. Do not mark ready, resolved, handoff-ready, planning-ready, or complete while triggered consequence obligations remain unresolved, unmapped, or unsupported by validation evidence.

## Execution Mode

## Dispatch Mode

Dispatch mode follows command tier, not a uniform rule.

| Tier | Dispatch Mode | Rule |
|------|---------------|------|
| trivial | leader-direct | No subagent dispatch. Leader performs and verifies the change directly. |
| light | subagent-preferred | Dispatch to one subagent; leader-inline fallback allowed if dispatch unavailable. |
| heavy | subagent-mandatory | Must dispatch. If dispatch unavailable, record reason and escalate. |

### Fallback (light tier only)

When subagent dispatch is unavailable for a light-tier command:
1. Record the reason in workflow state
2. Switch to `execution_surface: leader-inline`
3. Proceed with the same scope and verification gates

This is a designed fallback path, not an exception.

**This command tier: trivial. Dispatch mode: leader-direct.**

The leader performs the change directly. No subagent dispatch. No task contract needed.


## Scope Gate

Use `sp-fast` only when ALL of:
- ≤3 files touched
- No shared registration surface (router table, export barrel, template registry)
- No protocol/contract boundary crossed
- No dependency changes
- Task is clear in one sentence
- Root cause known (if bug fix)

If any check fails → upgrade to `/sp-quick`.
If scope >10 files or crosses module boundary → upgrade to `/sp-specify`.

## Fast Path Consequence Routing

The fast path may continue only when the Senior Consequence Analysis Gate does not trigger, or when it stands down with a recorded stand-down reason. If the gate triggers, upgrade out of `sp-fast` instead of adding planning artifacts to satisfy this gate on the fast path.

- Upgrade to `/sp-quick` immediately if the gate triggers with a bounded consequence model.
- Triggered gate with product, lifecycle, running-state, destructive-operation, shared-state, downstream-consumer, compatibility, security, or multiple-behavior semantics → route to `$sp-specify`.
- Stood-down or non-triggered gate → continue in `sp-fast` only after recording the stand-down reason in the fast-path closeout.

## Upgrade Triggers

Upgrade to `/sp-quick` immediately if:
- The Senior Consequence Analysis Gate triggers and the consequence model is bounded enough for lightweight tracking.
- The work expands to more than 3 files.
- The change touches a shared surface such as a router table, registration file, export barrel, template registry, or other coordination point.
- The project cognition runtime or change slice shows the touched area is a change-propagation hotspot, has explicit verification entry points beyond a trivial local check, or carries known unknowns that make safe direct execution unavailable.
- The task stops being obvious and needs research or clarification to proceed safely.
- The task needs multiple subagent lanes, resumable tracking, or a written quick-task summary artifact.
- The work started as a bug fix, but root-cause analysis is still unresolved, competing causes are still plausible, or the next safe step is diagnostic investigation rather than a truly local repair. In that case, route to `$sp-debug`.

Upgrade to `/sp-specify` immediately if:
- The Senior Consequence Analysis Gate triggers for lifecycle, running-state, shared-state, destructive-operation, downstream consumer impact, broad compatibility handling, security, or multiple plausible behavior choices that need product semantics.
- The request introduces a new workflow, role boundary, or user-visible behavior that needs explicit acceptance criteria.
- The change carries compatibility, migration, rollout, or neighboring-workflow risk.
- The task is no longer a bounded local fix and now changes architecture, APIs, long-lived templates, or planning assumptions.

## Passive Project Learning Layer

Fast path does not load the full passive learning layer.

**This command tier: trivial.** Skip all learning hooks. Do not read constitution, project-rules, or project-learnings. Do not run learning start, signal, review, or capture. Learning Reflex is acknowledged but not executed on the fast path; leave `.specify/memory/learnings/INDEX.md` and any linked detail document untouched unless the task is upgraded out of the fast path.

## Process

1. **Scope gate**
   - Confirm the task fits the fast-path constraints above.
   - If not, stop and redirect to the right workflow instead of forcing the task through `sp-fast`.

2. **Pass the project cognition gate**
   - {{spec-kit-include: ../command-partials/common/context-loading-gradient.md}}
   - **Project cognition gate:** query the active project's runtime before broad
     repository reads.

     Run or emulate:

     ```text
     C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe lexicon --intent implement --query=\"$ARGUMENTS\" --mode catalog --format json
     # Agent: retrieve the alias catalog, write semantic_intake with normalized_query, intent_facets, negative_constraints, and alias_interpretations; include selected_concepts, rejected_concepts, concept_decisions with covered_facets, missing_facets, match_sources, lexicon_generation_id, expanded_queries, repository_search_terms, and justified paths in <query_plan_json>. Candidate selection must satisfy facet coverage; do not trust top similarity alone. Derive project-language search terms from the alias catalog before reading source. Do not search only the raw user words; include component names, state names, file names, command names, UI labels, and route names from candidates, aliases, matched_terms, colloquial_matches, returned paths, normalized_query, and expanded_queries. Use these project-language search terms before broad repository search.
     C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query --intent implement --query-plan \"<query_plan_json>\" --format json
     ```

     Use the returned readiness:

     - `ready`: continue with the returned task-local bundle.
     - `review`: perform only the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing.
     - `ambiguous`: ask the user to select the intended candidate.
     - `needs_update`: route through `$sp-map-update`; this includes adoptable missing path-index coverage. Use map-update for ordinary existing-baseline gaps. Use map-scan -> map-build only for first/missing/unusable baseline, schema failure, schema v1 or old broad-schema rebuild-required readiness, zero active-generation path_index rows, missing or invalid alias_index, explicit_rebuild_requested, or baseline_identity_invalid.
     - `needs_rebuild`: route through `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build`; this is reserved for first/missing/unusable baseline, schema failure, schema v1 or old broad-schema rebuild-required readiness, zero active-generation path_index rows, missing or invalid alias_index, explicit_rebuild_requested, or baseline_identity_invalid.
     - `blocked`: stop and report the blocking runtime issue.
     - Pre-work map maintenance may record ordinary uncertain closure, partial/low-confidence facts, known unknowns, and `minimal_live_reads`. After a successful existing-baseline maintenance refresh, use `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe complete-refresh --format json` only for incremental freshness finalization; do not run `complete-refresh` as a rebuild finalizer.
     - **CARRY FORWARD**: Use project-cognition signals to decide whether
       fast-path execution is still safe. Carry the selected capability, minimal reads,
       and verification route into the fast-task state or report.
   - Only after the cognition gate passes may you read the source files to change.

3. **Execute the fast lane**
   - Perform the fast-path change directly.
   - Keep the allowed write scope local and explicit.
   - Before reading any non-obvious path, confirm the resolved path stays inside the repository and is not a credential, secret, private key, or other sensitive file. If path safety is uncertain, stop and ask for a safer explicit path instead of probing broadly.
   - If the task is behavior-changing rather than docs-only, write a failing targeted test or failing repro check before editing production code.
   - The direct execution notes must include that RED gate before production edits.
   - Do not use manual sanity checks as a substitute for red when behavior changes.
   - If no reliable automated test surface exists for the affected behavior, stop and redirect to `/sp-quick` or `/sp-specify` instead of hand-waving the verification gap.
   - For bug fixes and regressions, record the current root-cause explanation before implementation starts. If the root cause is not yet known, or if multiple plausible causes are still in play, stop and route to `$sp-debug` instead of applying a quick symptom patch.
   - Keep the change as small and local as possible.
   - If the Senior Consequence Analysis Gate stands down, record the stand-down reason before continuing in `sp-fast`.
   - Do not add planning artifacts to satisfy this gate on the fast path. If required consequence outputs are needed, upgrade instead of manufacturing durable artifacts in `sp-fast`.

4. **Verify**
   - If playbook command tiers exist, focused is the fast-lane acceptance check.
   - Otherwise run the smallest meaningful local verification for the change.
   - Prefer targeted existing tests or a direct sanity check over broad workflows.

5. **Report**
   - Summarize what changed, what was verified, and any remaining risk.
   - [AGENT] Keep the fast-path closeout truthful: report the exact verification you ran and any residual risk instead of implying broader validation.
   - Include `changed_code_paths` with modified, added, deleted, and renamed paths.
   - Include `changed_behavior_surfaces` for commands, APIs, templates, generated assets, state files, tests, docs, validators, packets, or runtime assumptions affected by the change.
   - Include `verification_evidence` with the exact checks run and the result.
   - {{spec-kit-include: ../command-partials/common/inline-project-cognition-update.md}}
   - The completion claim must be backed by live code, tests, scripts, configuration, or authoritative docs; project cognition can support route selection but cannot be the sole evidence for completion. Continue only when verification is truthfully green and no explicit blocker prevents completion.

## Output Contract

- Keep the outcome to one tightly scoped change set plus the minimum truthful verification evidence.
- Report what changed, which code paths were modified/added/deleted/renamed, which behavior surfaces moved, how it was verified, what residual risk remains, and the `project_cognition_refresh` outcome when the cognition runtime was affected.

## Guardrails

- No spec.md creation.
- No plan.md creation.
- No tasks.md creation.
- Use leader-direct execution only; if subagent lanes are needed, route to `$sp-quick`.
- Do not add planning artifacts just to satisfy process formality.
- If the task grows while working, stop and redirect to `/sp-quick`.
